# ditheringpy
Dither, extract, and change colours of images.

## Why?
The project was mainly an excuse to experiment with dithering (Floyd-Steinberg) and image colour extraction with k-means clustering. Aaaand a (cool?) instagram post is an added bonus.

## How to
1. Create a conda environment (or install packages as you wish) using `environment.yml`.
2. Clone the project.
3. Run main.py from your terminal and specify the source file/folder and destination folder. There are many options to play with, use `python main.py --help` to see them all.
4. Enjoy your dithered result.

## Important
The code may not always work as expected. This is not because of magic, but because of my very limited testing. If you notice issues or have suggestions, please let me know! In the meantime, have fun :)
